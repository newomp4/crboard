# crboard

An infinite canvas for collecting things — text, images, drawings, and **embedded
social media** (Instagram reels, YouTube videos, TikToks). Like Miro, but reels
play inline. Export any board to a single self-contained HTML file you can
share with anyone.

No accounts. No backend. No hosting bill.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Use it

- **Pan**: scroll, or hold space and drag, or middle-click drag.
- **Zoom**: ⌘/ctrl + scroll, or pinch on a trackpad.
- **Add text**: pick the text tool (T), click anywhere, type. Double-click to edit again.
- **Add image**: click the image button — or paste an image from your clipboard, or drag an image file onto the canvas.
- **Add an embed/link**: click the link button and paste a URL. YouTube / Instagram / TikTok / X / Vimeo / Spotify auto-detect into a playable embed; everything else becomes a link card. Embeds always show the source URL in a small footer below — click it to open the original page in a new tab.
- **Connect items with arrows**: pick the connector tool (`C`), drag from one item to another.
- **Draw**: pick the pen tool (P), drag.
- **Move / resize**: select an item with V (or just click), drag to move, drag corners to resize.
- **Click an embed once to select it** (the iframe is dim-locked while unselected so the wrapper can capture the click); click again — or click anywhere inside it after selection — to interact with the embedded page.
- **Right-click any item** for a context menu: bring to front / send to back / duplicate / open original / copy URL / delete.
- **Dark mode** — toggle with the moon/sun button in the top bar (persists across sessions; respects your OS preference on first run). The pen palette flips so the default stroke contrasts with the canvas. Exported `.html` files bake in whichever theme you chose.
- **Zoom controls** are bottom-right (− / 100% / +). Click "100%" to fit all content in the viewport.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — press `?` (or click the `?` in the top bar) for the full list.

### Shortcuts

| | |
|---|---|
| `V` / `T` / `P` / `C` | Select / Text / Pen / Connector |
| `⌘Z` | Undo |
| `⇧⌘Z` or `⌘Y` | Redo |
| `⌘D` | Duplicate selection |
| `⌘A` | Select all |
| `⌘C` / `⌘X` / `⌘V` | Copy / cut / paste selected items |
| `⌘]` / `⌘[` | Bring forward / send backward |
| `⌘0` | Reset zoom to 100% |
| `⌘1` | Fit all content in view |
| `⌘J` | Zoom to selection |
| Arrow keys | Nudge 1px (`⇧`+arrow = 10px) |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | Delete selection |
| `Esc` | Deselect |
| Hold `Space` + drag | Pan from any tool |
| Drag empty canvas | Rubber-band selection (`⇧` extends) |
| Resize image (or embed) | Aspect ratio is locked by default — hold `⇧` to free-resize |
| `?` | Open shortcuts overlay |
| Right-click an item | Context menu |

Boards autosave to your browser. **File → Save as `.crboard`** keeps a
portable JSON copy on disk.

## Share a board

**File → Export shareable .html** bundles the whole board into one HTML file:
the layout, your images (inlined), the drawings, and a tiny pan/zoom viewer.
Send the file via email, Drive, Dropbox, AirDrop — recipient double-clicks,
opens in any browser, can pan/zoom and watch the embeds. They don't need
crboard installed.

The exported file is view-only. They can re-import it in their own crboard
to keep editing (it's a valid `.crboard` JSON inside).

## How it works (short version)

- **Infinite canvas** is one HTML element with a CSS `transform:
  translate(x,y) scale(z)` applied. Items live inside it at "world"
  coordinates and the transform converts them to screen pixels. We use the
  DOM rather than a `<canvas>` element because canvases can't host iframes,
  and Instagram/YouTube/TikTok embeds *are* iframes.
- **Embeds** use each platform's plain `/embed` URL — no provider scripts,
  no API keys, no widgets to load.
- **Drawing** is recorded as `<path>` elements in an SVG layer so strokes
  scale crisply at any zoom.
- **State** is a single reducer; every change debounce-saves to
  `localStorage` so closing the tab doesn't lose your work.
- **Export** writes a self-contained HTML file with the board JSON in a
  `<script>` tag and a vanilla-JS viewer (no React, no dependencies) that
  re-renders it. The whole file is one inert document — no network calls
  beyond the embeds themselves.
